# Composite Numerical Integration (CNI) using Mathematica

Newton-Cotes formulas are not accurate for a large integral domain. The main idea of the CNI is to divide integral domain into subdomains and use simple integration rule for each subdomain.

Using the Mathematica, I computed composite numerical integration over a quadrilateral region. We described the composite numerical integration over an arbitrary quadrilateral region in our following paper:
